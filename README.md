Timers for EPIC RPG Discord game bot.

Allows you to use cooldown presets or edit all your own times and labels. 

Has text to speech that can read out labels. Example:"rpg adventure" when the adventure timer finishes.

Tips:
 - Nothing saves when you close the program. I didn't want to write files all over my/your machine.
 - Changing a time in the box changes it when you hit the enter key while in the box. 
 - There's no pausing, it restarts the timer from the beginning when resuming from a stopped state.
 - I just change resize the window manually to hide the options once I have em set how I need em.
